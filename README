ABOUT

DroidReader is a PDF reader targeted at the Android Platform.
It is heavily based on the MuPDF software/library.

PREREQUISITES

In order to build DroidReader, you need:

- the sources of DroidReader, but you managed that already...

- source code of the MuPDF software/library

- source code of libjpeg

- source code of freetype2

- the Android Native Development Kit (NDK)

- and of course the Android SDK.

Optionally, you might want to use Eclipse and the Android plugin
for development. The sources are structured to easily have them
imported as a new project.

When you have done this, do the following:

- Currently, you need to build MuPDF on your _host_ system once.
  This is due to the basic fonts and charmaps, which we need
  and which are converted to .c files for compilation into
  the MuPDF library. So change to the root of your MuPDF
  sources, and issue the following command:

  $ jam

  It should then build. If it doesn't, that might be because
  you don't have the jam utility installed yet. See MuPDF's
  documentation for all the details.

- copy the font_*.c and cmap_*.c files from the

  build/<platform-config>/

  directory within the MuPDF sources into the

  jni/fonts/  and  jni/cmaps/

  directories of the DroidReader project tree.

- copy or symlink the libjpeg sources to the

  jni/jpeg-7/

  folder.

- copy or symlink the freetype2 sources into the

  jni/freetype/

  folder.

- copy or symlink the MuPDF sources into the

  jni/mupdf/

  folder.

- make a symlink to the project root directory (containing
  this file) into the Android NDK's

  app/

  folder.

Your project tree is now ready.


COMPILING

The first step is to compile the native JNI library. In order to
do that, change your current working dir to the JNI root directory
and start the make run:

  $ make APP=droidreader

(this is for the case you named the symlink "droidreader")

Until now, the author only used the Eclipse IDE with the Android
plugin to build the application. So just open the project and have
Eclipse build it.


DOWNLOAD

The latest sources of this application should always be available
at the following web site:

http://code.google.com/p/droidreader


INSTALLING

You can use the Android SDK's "adb install" command to install
the readily built .apk package.
